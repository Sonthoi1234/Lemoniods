# Lemoniods p2
This is where I upload beta versions of my new game "Lemoniod Invasion 2". The first one did a pretty good job at farming views and gain populairity to my account, but it ain't doing well at fixing bugs... So I decided to make another version of it, featuring many new stuffs such as the shop, achievements, pause menu, health bars, etc. Right now my Scratch coding skills have increased time to time, so I can fix some bugs that are so-called "impossible" before ;)

I'm not gonna upload this project until the beta-testing period ends. In the meantime, you can have a playtest of the game before it's official release! Wondering if 1.7 is the last version of the testing period? Stay tuned for more crazy updates and stuffs!

You can also find me on Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Sonthoi-lol2 or maybe on Reddit (new!): https://www.reddit.com/user/Sonthoi

Enjoy!
